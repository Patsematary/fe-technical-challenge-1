## Backstory

The following application is a CRA project that's supposed to serve as an online pizza builder for a pizza restaurant that prides
itself on serving all kinds of variations and combinations.

The previous developer had an argument with the owner regarding pineapple on pizza and he no longer works here!

## Objective

The project is missing a few key features for the store to launch their new pizza builder site! Here are the remaining specs:

- The user must be able to select multiple toppings
- the user must be presented with a checkout screen with a summary of their pizza options with detailed prices, tax, and all totals
- after checkout the user must be taken to a thank you page with CTA to go home
- state must be cleared after checkout

### bonus

- typescript
- animations
- match code patterns
